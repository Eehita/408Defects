# Aidera

Individuals use innumerable applications everyday. Integration of essential applications in a simple chat service would be a useful tool for many. We intend to build Aidera, a Facebook Messenger bot that helps people access different services in one window. This bot will work as an everyday companion to enhance users experience by accessing information of their favorite applications.

We intend to provide access to two services  i.e. ***Yelp*** and ***Airbnb***.

##Technologies:

1. A Facebook Messenger chat bot that allows users to access various applications like Yelp, Airbnb etc.
2. Use a Natural Language Processing API i.e. Recast.ai to understand intent of the userâ€™s message, accordingly give an appropriate reply and query relevant information to/from database.
3. A backend system using Node.js algorithms to efficiently process information.
4. A MongoDB database to help with context management to hold a smooth conversation with the user.
